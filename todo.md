## ðŸŽ‰ SUCCESS ACHIEVED

**Root Cause:** React frontend (port 5175) couldn't communicate with Flask backend (port 5000) due to missing proxy configuration.

**Solution:** Added proxy configuration to vite.config.js to forward `/api` and `/data` requests to the backend.

**Result:** Featured page now displays images correctly with full functionality restored.

## ðŸ“‹ TECHNICAL DETAILS
- Issue was NOT in the React component code (it was working correctly)
- Issue was in the development environment configuration
- Added proxy forwarding for both API calls and image serving
- All Featured page functionality now works as expected
